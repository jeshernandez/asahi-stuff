This is a documentation page about Asahi Linux, Linux on Apple Silicon. Learn more about Asahi Linux in their [About](https://asahilinux.org/about/) section. 

At the time of this writing, I have been using Asahi Linux for three (3) days. I love it. I intend on documenting useful configurations, and even creating some videos that may help others. 

Examples: Configure Outlook, Microsoft Teams, Video Recording with OBS Studio, Software Development with Visual Code, and IntelliJ. Finally, video game development using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

Some additional useful configurations is an entire demo of an already configured desktop video, and offering documentation for each feature here.
