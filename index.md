This is a documentation page on using Asahi Fedora Linux on Apple Silicon M1/M2. Learn more about Asahi Linux in their [About](https://asahilinux.org/about/) section. Specifically, this is a documentation page on setting up your system for a day-to-day user. Meaning, can you work a corporate job (the most restricted) with Asahi Linux? Meaning, Kubernetes in Azure requires kubelogin, specific AAD Azure Login, etc. Obviously if you require VPN/Proxy, then using your personal laptop will not work for you, duh. Otherwise, so far, yes. 

- Microsoft Teams [YES]
- Microsoft Outlook [YES]
- .. you get it..

I intend on documenting useful configurations, and even creating some videos that may help others. Not just from a day-to-day software engineer, but also as a hobbyist. 

<b>Not everything is roses--yet</b>. I have not figured out how to install Discord yet. Workaround? Using the browser option. 3D printing? I own a Bambu Lab A1. The Bambu Studio software studio is available, however the networking piece is not working yet. Working on figuring this one out. 

<b>This is an open source documentation.</b> That means, if you have something cool to add or maybe figured out a way to solve something. Feel free to [contribute!](https://github.com/jeshernandez/asahi-stuff)

For those interested in installing Asahi Linux. THis is the first video I stumbled into, which was very useful.
